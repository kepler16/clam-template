# Clam - JAM Stack for CLJS

## DO NOT USE THIS TOOL!!
It is very very alpha. Things will change. Completely. Including the name and namespace layout.

# Vercel
Currently relies on vercel for dev build. So you need to `vercel link` the project.

# Evaluation
```
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/clam dev
```
